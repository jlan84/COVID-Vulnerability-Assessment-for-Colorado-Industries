    "What industries show the highest COVID-19 outbreak incidents in Colorado, what areas are these industries in, and what are the primary ethnicities of the labor force for these industries?  Is the work environment contributing to the spread of COVID-19?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary data sets that I will be focusing on come from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.  The datasets are updated weekly, so the latest data for the project will be coming from 7/15/2020.  I will not limit myself to this data, but it will be the backbone of my analysis.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to determine if workers in certain industries are more vulnerable to catching COVID-19, what the primary ethnicity emplyed by those industries is, and what factors would contribute to the transmissibility of COVID-19 in those higher risk industries.\n",

    "A secondary goal is to take a deeper dive into these industries.  I would like to take a look at wage/salary levels, exposure rates (with the public), risk aversion, etc. that may contribute to the spread of COVID-19 within the population that is employed by these industries.    "
