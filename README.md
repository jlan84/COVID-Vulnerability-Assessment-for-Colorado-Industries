# An Ethnical Approach to COVID Risk Assessment for Colorado Industries

## Introduction

Colorado is a highly diversified state, from it's population to environments.  With a total population of 5.78 million, the Hispanic people represent 24% of Coloradans and this number is projected to grow to 35% by the year 2050 (based on the 2018 Census).  The COVID 19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on all Coloradans, but the impact on the Hispanic community has been much higher than predicted.  A staggering 36% of the people that have been inficted by COVID 19 are of Hispanic descent, this number should only be around 24% based on the Hispanic proportion of the population.  Why is this number so high?  This study aims to dertermine if economical factors have a role in this abnormally high infection rate.

The questions that this study will focus on are:
 * Which industries show the highest incidents of outbreaks in Colorado?
 * What is the primary ethnicity employed by these industries?
 * What factors may contribute to a higher infection rate in these industries?
 * What areas of Colorado have the highest number of outbreaks?
 * What is the sectoral trend?

## Raw Data

The majority of the data used in this study came from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
