# COVID Vulnerability Assessment for Colorado Industries

## Introduction

Colorado is a highly diversified state, from it's population to environments.  With a total population of 5.78 million, the Hispanic people represent 24% of Coloradans and this number is projected to grow to 35% by the year 2050 (based on the 2018 Census CO Pop Forecasts final.xlsx is included in the data folder).  The COVID 19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on all Coloradans, but the impact on the Hispanic community has been much higher than predicted.  A staggering 36% of the people that have been inficted by COVID 19 are of Hispanic descent, this number should only be around 24% based on the Hispanic proportion of the population.  Why is this number so high?  There are many factors that may affect this number, this study aims to dertermine if the worklpace environment is contributing to the infection volume in the Hispanic community.

The questions that this study will focus on are:

 * Which industries show the highest incidents of outbreaks in Colorado?
 * What is the primary ethnicity employed by these industries?
 * What areas of Colorado have the highest number of outbreaks?

## Raw Data

The data for this project came from three main sources.  The data on outbreak by industry and ethnicity by county came from the Colorado Department of Pulic Health and Environment (https://covid19.colorado.gov/).  The outbreak data is categorized by industry type and is updated on a weekly basis as new industries report outbreaks.  The median salary by industry data was takend from Statistical Atlas (https://statisticalatlas.com/state/Colorado/Industries).  Worker ethnicity by industry was unavailabe for Colorado, so the US data was used in it's place.  This data came from US Bureau of Labor and Statistics (USBLS) (https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm).  All census data is based on the last census performed in 2018 and current population projections and is included in the data folder.  


### Data Cleaning Workflow

1. The outbreak data conatained 120 different industries which needed to be funneled into the 12 industries used for the USBLS shown below. The breakout data also contained the county names from which the breakouts occurred.  I stripped the white space and replaced a few that were incorrect.

|    | Industry                  |
|---:|:--------------------------|
|  0 | Agg/Fish/Forestry/Hunting |
|  1 | Construction              |
|  2 | Education/Health Services |
|  3 | Financial Activities      |
|  4 | Government                |
|  5 | Hospitality               |
|  6 | Manufacturing             |
|  7 | Mining/OilandGas          |
|  8 | Other Services            |
|  9 | Prof Serv and Mgmt        |
| 10 | Transp/Warehouse          |
| 11 | Wholesale/Retail          |

2. I added then added "Median Salaries by Industry" to the primary table

3. I then used these county names to merge the hispanic population table.  By county table into the primary table.

4. I used the desginatd Industry names to rename the industries from the USBLS in order to merge the tables on='Industry'.


5. I used some grouping methods on the DataFrames to reduce this table down to the one shown below.  Becuase the ethnicity of the staff that were infected was not disclosed, I used the percentage of Hispanics employed by the industry to calculate the "Hispanic Staff Infected" column.

|    | Industry                  |   Total Staff Infected |   Hispanic Percentage |   Hispanic Staff Infected |
|---:|:--------------------------|-----------------------:|----------------------:|--------------------------:|
|  0 | Agg/Fish/Forestry/Hunting |                     47 |                 27.5  |                        13 |
|  1 | Construction              |                     44 |                 30.4  |                        13 |
|  2 | Education/Health Services |                   2354 |                 13.5  |                       318 |
|  3 | Financial Activities      |                      0 |                 12.9  |                         0 |
|  4 | Government                |                    115 |                 12.5  |                        14 |
|  5 | Hospitality               |                    139 |                 24    |                        33 |
|  6 | Manufacturing             |                    483 |                 16.8  |                        81 |
|  7 | Mining/OilandGas          |                     15 |                 20.1  |                         3 |
|  8 | Other Services            |                      3 |                 19.9  |                         1 |
|  9 | Prof Serv and Mgmt        |                     98 |                 16    |                        16 |
| 10 | Transp/Warehouse          |                     94 |                 19.45 |                        18 |
| 11 | Wholesale/Retail          |                    154 |                 18.1  |                        28 |

6. I grouped and sorted the main table by "Total Staff Infection" and then merged this with the hispanic population table on="County Name" in order to compare "Total Staff Infected" with the "Hispanic Population Percentage".


## EDA Workflow

1.  This study is meant to determine if there is a correlation between Hispanic populations work environment and the abnormally high COVID19 infection rate in the Hispanic Population.  So to start things off, I plotted the Total Staff Infections by Industry and the Hispanic Staff Infections.  The table below depicts the results.  The highest number of staff infections ocurred in the Education and Health Service Industry.  This industry also includes Social Assistance. Because the ethnicity of the infected staff was not disclosed, the amount of Hispanic Staff Infected was calculated using the Total Infected mulitplied by the USBLS data for Hispanic % in each of these industries.

</p>

2. Next I looked at the Total Staff Infections by County, sorting them from largest to smallest and removing the counties that have not reported outbreaks.  The table clearly shows that most of the infections are around major metropolitan areas.

3.  I then took a look at the Hispanic Population % by County shown in the graph below.  I highlighted the top 10 Counties with the highest infection rate in red. The counties with the highest hispanic population percentages are on the lower end of the Total Staff Infected by County.

</p>

4. In order to get a better visual comparison of Hispanic Population and Staff Infected by County, I used a scatter plot (shown below).  There does not seem strong correlation between the two.
<p align="center">
<img src="Figures/infected_vs_hispanic_pop.png" height="600" width="800" />
</p>
5. To further analyze the correlation for Staff Infected by County vs Hispanic Population, I ran a Pearson correlation between the two sets of data. The Pearson correlation coefficient came out to be 0.1128, which implies that there is very little correlation between the Total Staff Infected and the Hispanic Population Percentage.

|                      |   Total Staff Infected |   Perc_Hispanic_Pop |
|:---------------------|-----------------------:|--------------------:|
| Total Staff Infected |            1        |         0.112777     |
| Perc_Hispanic_Pop    |        0.112777 |            1         |

6. Next I took a look at the Median Income of each Industry.  The self sufficiency standard outlines the necessary annual income various sized families need in order avoid having to accept outside assistance.  For each county in Colorado there is a set value for the income, because most of the outbreaks occurred in and around Denver county, we will use the values of $61,553.10 for a single parent and one infant and $88,436.04 for two adults, one infant and one pre-schooler.  The plot below shows the Median Salary for each Industry in this study and the bars highlighted in red are the Industries with the highest amount of staff reported to have contracted COVID19.  All of the top 5 fall below the self sufficiency standard for a single parent.

## Conclusion

This study was meant to determine if the Hispanic population in Colorado was more susceptible to contracting COVID19 in there work environments.  The breakout data did not include the ethnicity for the staff that were infected. The ethnicity employed by the industries came for US data and not specifically Colorado.  We made the assumption that the ethnicity of the employees for the Industries in Colorado reflects that of the entire US and that the amount of Hispanic Staff infected with COVID19 is the same percentage as those that work in each specific Industry.  Therefore, currently we are unable to state with absolute confidence that the Hispanic population is or is not more susceptible to contracting COVID19 at work.  The current data shows that they are not more susceptible and are just as likely of contracing COVID19 as any other ethnicity.  Efforts are being made to include ethnicity when reporting outbreaks by industry and to obtain Colorado ethnicity percentages by industry.  With these two pieces of information, the conlcusion may be modified.  That being said, there are other conlcusions that we can draw from the study.  I will preface the rest of my conlusions with the fact that some of these industries were shut down, almost entirely, during the quarantine period of 2 months, during which outbreak data was being collected.  This means that there may be a shift in which Industries are showing the highest numbers of Staff COVID19 cases.  Below are the rest of the conlcusions that I have drawn from this study.

1. The current data shows that the most susceptible employees are those working in Education and Health Services, which also includes Social Assistance.  The second highest Staff cases came from the Manufacturing Industry.  This seems logical due to the nature of these Industries, as the employees may not be able to take all of the necessary precautions to perform their job.  Many of the sub industries categorized under these main categories were considered essential and therefore were not included in the mandatory shutdown.

2. The counties surrounding major metropolitan areas have the highest number of outbreaks and infected staff. This also seems logical due to the amount of people working in these areas. 

3. As to why employees working in these Industries are more susceptible to contracting COVID19, it is difficult to say due to the amount of confounding variables. One thing to highlight, for which we did have data on, was the Median Salary of the employees working in these industries.  I mentioned previously that the employees from the top 5 Industries with the highest cases had Median Salaries below the self sufficiency standard, which may reflect their ability to properly protect themselves.  

This study will be an ongoing effort to improve upon the conclusion that have been drawn.
